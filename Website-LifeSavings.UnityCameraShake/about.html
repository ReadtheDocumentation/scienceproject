          <h1>Hi, thanks for visiting my site.</h1>

          <p>
            With over a year and a half of development experience, 
            I became fluent in Java, C#, and parts of Kotlin. 
            I also began working on a few industries, 
            such as modern video-game development, 3d rendering and animating, computer networking, 
            and android app development.
          </p>

          <p>
            I was only 11 when I got interested in computer science and development in general. 
            I didn't have much to work with. But with the help of YouTube and other coding sources, 
            I was able to get help and create new things along the way. 
          </p>

          <p>
            I hope this story maybe inspired you to go out there, and find a hobby that interests you.
            It doesn't have to be big, but just something to keep your mind occupied during
            our time in quarantine. 
          </p>
